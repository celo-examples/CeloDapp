Exploring Celo-specific Python library called celo-sdk, which provides a wrapper around the web3py library and enables you to interact with the Celo network and smart contracts. To get started, you can create a new project directory and install celo-sdk using pip. Then, you can import celo_sdk into your Python file and use it to connect to the Celo network and interact with smart contracts. By building on Celo with web3py and celo-sdk, you can take advantage of Celo's fast and affordable transactions, built-in mobile compatibility, and growing ecosystem of DeFi applications
